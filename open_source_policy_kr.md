# Open Source Policy Template for OpenChain Specification

 (A)        [COMPANY] understands that Open Source permits the use, study, improvement and sharing of software without seeking further permission. Open Source is a broadening and valuable resource:
(A1)        Providing quality software and software-based services;
(A2)        Reducing vendor lock-in;
(A3)        Reducing the likelihood of security issues;
(A4)        Reducing development time;
(A5)        Granting access to developer communities;
(A6)        Aiding the attraction and retention of quality staff.

(B)  [COMPANY] also understands that using Open Source or proprietary software presents some risks and that:  
(B1)  Open Source is not automatically high quality;  
(B2)  Open Source licensing is complex, and compliance with the licensing terms needs careful consideration, documentation and following of processes;  
(B3)  Other software which has some similar characteristics to Open Source (such as non-commercial or shared source) is not Open Source;  
(B4)  Incorrect deployment and distribution of Open Source can lead to breaches of intellectual property rights, which, if they can be remedied at, may only be remediable by the release of our trade secrets, including source code;  
(B5)  It can be difficult to find warranty cover for Open Source code and performance;  
(B6)  Open Source can be misunderstood, and may be viewed suspiciously by customers and investors.

(C)  The purpose of this policy is to assist [COMPANY] in getting the best business value from Open Source while mitigating the risks. All Software Staff will be made aware of this Policy though, for example, training, internal wiki/knowledge base.
